## 🎯 Additional Techniques to Boost Accuracy Further

### Option 1: Feature Engineering (Potentially +2-5%)
Add temporal features to capture patterns:
```python
# Add hour of day, day of week, month
df['hour'] = df['timestamp'].dt.hour
df['day_of_week'] = df['timestamp'].dt.dayofweek
df['is_weekend'] = df['day_of_week'].isin([5, 6]).astype(int)

# Rolling statistics
df['cpu_rolling_mean'] = df['cpu_utilization'].rolling(window=6).mean()
df['cpu_rolling_std'] = df['cpu_utilization'].rolling(window=6).std()
```

### Option 2: Attention Mechanism (Potentially +1-3%)
Add attention layers to focus on important timesteps:
```python
class AttentionLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(self.attention(lstm_out), dim=1)
        context = torch.sum(attention_weights * lstm_out, dim=1)
        return self.fc(context)
```

### Option 3: Ensemble Methods (Potentially +2-4%)
Combine multiple models:
```python
# Train 3-5 models with different:
# - Random seeds
# - Architectures (LSTM, GRU, Transformer)
# - Hyperparameters

# Average predictions
final_prediction = (model1_pred + model2_pred + model3_pred) / 3
```

### Option 4: Data Augmentation (Potentially +1-2%)
Generate synthetic variations:
```python
# Add slight noise to training data
noise = np.random.normal(0, 0.01, X_train.shape)
X_train_augmented = X_train + noise

# Time warping - stretch/compress sequences slightly
```

### Option 5: Use GRU Instead of LSTM (May vary)
GRU often performs similarly with fewer parameters:
```python
self.gru = nn.GRU(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
```

### Option 6: Hyperparameter Tuning (Potentially +1-3%)
Use grid search or Bayesian optimization:
```python
param_grid = {
    'hidden_size': [64, 128, 256],
    'num_layers': [2, 3, 4],
    'learning_rate': [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001],
    'dropout': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
    'sequence_length': [12, 24, 36]
}
```

### Option 7: Loss Function Modification
Try different loss functions:
```python
# Huber Loss (robust to outliers)
criterion = nn.HuberLoss(delta=1.0)

# Custom weighted loss (penalize high CPU mispredictions more)
def weighted_mse(pred, target):
    weights = torch.where(target > 0.7, 2.0, 1.0)
    return torch.mean(weights * (pred - target) ** 2)
```
