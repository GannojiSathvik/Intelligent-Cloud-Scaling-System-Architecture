## 🔧 Techniques Applied in Detail

### 1. Feature Engineering ✅
**Added 12 new features:**
- **Temporal Features:**
  - `hour` - Hour of day (0-23)
  - `day_of_week` - Day of week (0-6)
  - `is_weekend` - Binary weekend indicator
  - `is_business_hours` - Business hours (9 AM-5 PM weekdays)
  - `time_category` - Time of day (night/morning/afternoon/evening)

- **Rolling Statistics (6-period window = 30 minutes):**
  - `cpu_rolling_mean` - Moving average
  - `cpu_rolling_std` - Moving standard deviation
  - `cpu_rolling_min` - Moving minimum
  - `cpu_rolling_max` - Moving maximum
  - `cpu_diff` - Rate of change

- **Network/Request Features:**
  - `network_rolling_mean` - Network traffic moving average
  - `request_rolling_mean` - Request count moving average

**Total Features:** 16 (from original 4)

### 2. Attention Mechanism ✅
Implemented attention layer that:
- Calculates attention weights for each timestep
- Focuses on important temporal patterns
- Improves model interpretability
- Adds ~10% more parameters but improves learning

```python
class AttentionLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(AttentionLayer, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    
    def forward(self, lstm_output):
        attention_weights = torch.softmax(self.attention(lstm_output), dim=1)
        context_vector = torch.sum(attention_weights * lstm_output, dim=1)
        return context_vector, attention_weights
```

### 3. Ensemble Models ✅
**5 diverse models trained with different configurations:**

| Model | Hidden Size | Layers | Dropout | Test Loss | Accuracy |
|-------|------------|--------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Model 1 | 128 | 3 | 0.20 | 0.004919 | 78.30% |
| Model 2 | 96 | 2 | 0.30 | 0.004489 | 77.72% |
| Model 3 | 160 | 3 | 0.15 | 0.004821 | 78.51% ⭐ |
| Model 4 | 128 | 4 | 0.25 | 0.004667 | 76.78% |
| Model 5 | 112 | 2 | 0.20 | 0.005656 | 77.25% |

**Ensemble Strategy:** Average predictions from all 5 models

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning ✅
**Grid Search Results (10 combinations tested):**
- Tested: `hidden_size` × `num_layers` × `dropout` × `learning_rate`
- Best found: hidden=96, layers=3, dropout=0.15, lr=0.0003
- Best loss achieved: 0.005073

## 📈 What Actually Improved Accuracy?

### Effective Improvements:
1. ✅ **Sequence Length: 12 → 36 timesteps** - Captures 3 hours instead of 1 hour
2. ✅ **Deeper Networks: 2 → 3-4 layers** - More learning capacity
3. ✅ **Larger Hidden Size: 50 → 128-160** - Better feature representation
4. ✅ **Feature Engineering** - Temporal patterns help model understand cycles
5. ✅ **Attention Mechanism** - Focus on important time periods
6. ✅ **Regularization: Dropout + Gradient Clipping** - Prevents overfitting

### Why Ensemble Didn't Improve Further:
- Individual models are already highly correlated (similar data, similar architecture)
- All models explain ~93% variance (hitting data's inherent noise limit)
- For significant ensemble gains, need more diverse approaches (e.g., LSTM + GRU + Transformer)

## 💡 Why Can't We Get to 85-90% Accuracy?

### Theoretical Limits:
1. **Data Noise:** CPU utilization has inherent randomness from:
   - OS background processes
   - Network variability
   - User behavior unpredictability

2. **Model Ceiling:** With R² = 0.93-0.94, we're explaining ~94% of variance
   - Remaining 6% is likely random noise
   - MAPE of ~22% means errors are distributed across predictions

3. **Feature Limitations:** Even with 16 features, some patterns are invisible:
   - External events (DDoS attacks, viral traffic spikes)
   - Hardware-specific issues
   - Seasonal business trends beyond our data

### To Reach 82-85% Accuracy, You Would Need:
- ✅ **More diverse data sources** (application logs, user sessions, etc.)
- ✅ **Longer training history** (months/years of patterns)
- ✅ **External features** (marketing campaigns, holidays, weather)
- ✅ **Multi-modal ensemble** (LSTM + GRU + Transformer + XGBoost)
- ✅ **Transfer learning** from similar systems
