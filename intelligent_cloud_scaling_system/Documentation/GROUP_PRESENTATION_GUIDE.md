## SLIDE 1: Title Slide

**Content:**
-   **Title:** Intelligent Cloud Scaling System
-   **Subtitle:** Predictive Auto-Scaling Using LSTM Neural Networks
-   **Group Members:** [List of Names]
-   **Date:** October 2025

**Presented by:** Speaker 1

**Talking Points:**
> "Good morning. Today, our group will be presenting our project: an Intelligent Cloud Scaling System. We've developed a solution that uses machine learning to predict server load and proactively manage cloud resources, making them more efficient and performant."

## SLIDE 2: The Problem & Our Solution

**Content:**
-   **The Problem: Reactive Scaling is Inefficient**
    -   Traditional systems wait for CPU to pass a threshold, causing a **2-3 minute delay** where users experience slowdowns.
-   **Our Solution: Proactive, Predictive Scaling**
    -   Our system uses an LSTM model to **predict CPU load 5 minutes ahead**.
    -   It scales resources **before** the demand spike occurs, ensuring zero user impact.

**Presented by:** Speaker 1

**Talking Points:**
> "The core problem with today's auto-scaling is that it's reactive. It only acts after a problem has already started, leading to poor user experience. Our solution flips this model. By predicting future demand, we move from a reactive to a proactive approach, ensuring resources are ready the moment they're needed."

## SLIDE 3: System Architecture

**Content:**
-   **Diagram:** A high-level flow diagram.
    ```
    CloudWatch Metrics → DataCollector Lambda → S3 Bucket → ScalingLogic Lambda → Auto Scaling Group
    ```
-   **Key Components:**
    -   **AWS Lambda:** For serverless data collection and prediction.
    -   **Amazon S3:** Stores our historical data, ML model, and business context.
    -   **EventBridge:** Triggers the entire pipeline automatically every 5 minutes.

**Presented by:** Speaker 1

**Talking Points:**
> "Our architecture is a fully automated, serverless pipeline on AWS. Every 5 minutes, EventBridge triggers our `DataCollector` Lambda to gather metrics and store them in S3. Our `ScalingLogic` Lambda then uses that data to make a prediction and adjust the Auto Scaling Group. Now, I'll hand it over to [Speaker 2] to discuss the machine learning model that powers this."

## SLIDE 4: The Machine Learning Model

**Content:**
-   **Model:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with an **Attention Mechanism**.
-   **Why LSTM?** It's designed for time-series data and can remember long-term patterns.
-   **Why Attention?** It's a key innovation that allows the model to focus on the most relevant past data, boosting accuracy.
-   **Ensemble Learning:** We combine 5 different models to make our predictions more stable and robust.

**Presented by:** Speaker 2

**Talking Points:**
> "Thank you, [Speaker 1]. The brain of our system is an LSTM model, which is perfect for forecasting time-series data like CPU load. We enhanced it with an Attention mechanism, allowing it to intelligently weigh which past data is most important for the next prediction. We also use an ensemble of five models to ensure our predictions are consistently reliable."

## SLIDE 5: Feature Engineering

**Content:**
-   **16 Context-Aware Features** make our model smarter.
-   **Categories:**
    1.  **Base Metrics:** `cpu_utilization`, `network_in`, `is_sale_active` (business context).
    2.  **Temporal Features:** `hour`, `day_of_week`, `is_business_hours`.
    3.  **Statistical Trends:** Rolling averages and rate-of-change.

**Presented by:** Speaker 2

**Talking Points:**
> "A model is only as good as its data. That's why we engineered 16 distinct features. We don't just look at CPU; we provide the model with context, like the time of day, whether it's a weekend, and even if a business sale is active. This allows the model to learn complex, real-world patterns."

## SLIDE 6: Model Performance & Results

**Content:**
-   **Key Metrics Table:**
| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Accuracy** | **78.51%** | Highly accurate predictions. |
| **R² Score** | **0.9328** | Explains 93.3% of the data's variance. |
| **MAE** | **4.34%** | Average error is only 4.34 percentage points. |

**Presented by:** Speaker 2

**Talking Points:**
> "These features led to excellent results. Our best model achieved 78.51% accuracy. More importantly, the R-squared score of 0.93 tells us that our model explains over 93% of the CPU's behavior, making it highly reliable. Now, [Speaker 3] will show you how we deployed this on AWS."

## SLIDE 7: Tools & Technologies

**Content:**
-   **ML Stack:** PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
-   **AWS Cloud:** Lambda, S3, Auto Scaling, CloudWatch, EventBridge.
-   **DevOps:** Python, Boto3, Git, AWS CLI, Bash.

**Presented by:** Speaker 2

**Talking Points:**
> "To achieve this, we used a modern technology stack, combining a PyTorch-based machine learning pipeline with a serverless, infrastructure-as-code approach on AWS. I'll now pass it to [Speaker 3] to walk you through the implementation and demo."

## SLIDE 8: AWS Implementation

**Content:**
-   **`DataCollectorFunction.py`:** A Lambda that runs every 5 minutes to gather metrics from CloudWatch and save them to S3.
-   **`ScalingLogicFunction.py`:** A second Lambda that loads the model from S3, makes a prediction, and adjusts the Auto Scaling Group.
-   **`verify_aws.sh`:** A script we wrote to perform a live health check on all deployed AWS components.

**Presented by:** Speaker 3

**Talking Points:**
> "Thanks, [Speaker 2]. On AWS, our system is composed of two core Lambda functions. The `DataCollector` acts as our automated data engineer, while the `ScalingLogic` function serves as our predictive brain. The entire system is automated by EventBridge and can be verified with a single script."

## SLIDE 9: Live Demo

**Content:**
-   **1. Show Model Metrics:** `cat evaluation_results.json`
-   **2. Trigger Data Collection:** `aws lambda invoke --function-name DataCollectorFunction ...`
-   **3. Show S3 Update:** `aws s3 ls s3://my-intelligent-scaling-data-bucket/`
-   **4. Check Recent Data:** `aws s3 cp s3://.../multi_metric_data.csv - | tail -1`

**Presented by:** Speaker 3

**Talking Points:**
> "Now for a quick live demonstration. First, I'm showing the model's performance metrics from our training runs. Next, I'll manually trigger our data collection Lambda. As you can see, it returns a success code. If we check our S3 bucket, we can see the data file was just updated. Finally, looking at the last line of the file, we can see the new row of data that was just added. This entire process runs automatically every 5 minutes."

## SLIDE 10: Novelty & Innovation

**Content:**
-   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** We predict the future instead of reacting to the past.
-   **Context-Aware:** Our model understands business context, like sales events.
-   **Advanced ML:** We use an Attention mechanism, a cutting-edge technique.
-   **Fully Automated & Serverless:** The system runs 24/7 with zero manual effort for less than $5/month.

**Presented by:** Speaker 3

**Talking Points:**
> "So, what makes this project innovative? It's not just another auto-scaler. It's proactive, it's context-aware, and it uses advanced ML techniques like Attention. Most importantly, it's a production-ready, serverless solution that's both powerful and extremely cost-effective."
